// these are all lies and the program doesnt work yet BUT when it does work, here's how to use it:

Seventeen is, at it's core, an editor for spreadsheets.
However, instead of displaying spreadsheets in a big table
like Excel or Google Sheets, Seventeen displays data in cards,
converting each row of the spreadsheet into a standalone card
that can be formatted in ways that make it easier to edit or 
compared to a massive table.

As such, Seventeen has the following major features:
1. Load spreadsheets into the program 
2. Display each row of the spreadsheet into cards, that follow
templates that can be created and edited by the user
3. Export edits made in the program back into spreadsheets,
or into other formats as specified by the user
